  - heading: VFX Graph for Flipbook Animation

      like fire, where you can make the sheet externally, or hand drawn effects.

  - heading: Orientation
    text: The first example is set to face towards the camera plane. The second example
      is set to keep it's object rotation. Different effects make sense to handle
      this in different ways.
