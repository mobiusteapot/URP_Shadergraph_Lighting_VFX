  - heading: Spotlight
    text: Spotlights cast lights in a single direction with a specified angle. Spotlights
      are the most performant realtime light. Because you have so much control over
      the positioning of spotlights, using a large number of spotlights is common
      to create good, balanced lighting in a scene.

  - heading: Baked Lighting
    text: This light is baked, meaning if you adjust the color, intensity, or position
      of the light, it will not update. To update it, you must rebake the lights.
      You can do this by going to Window > Rendering > Lighting, and selecting "Generate
      Lightmaps". You can read more about the limitations of baked lighting below.
