  - heading: VFX Graph With Mesh Output
    text: VFX Graphs can output particles in a few ways. The default way you probably
      think of when you see a particle is a flat, 2D quad with a texture, which always
      faces the camera. Particles can also sample meshes, which recieve lighting
      information.

    text: You can open this example by selecting "Mesh Effect Cube" and double clicking
      "Fractal Mesh Effect".

  - heading: 
    text: Particle effects must be linear and cannot loop, but they can trigger a
      secondary particle effect when their lifetime ends. This example triggers an
      indentical subgraph after each lifetime (with the exception of the scale being
      reduced on each repetition).
