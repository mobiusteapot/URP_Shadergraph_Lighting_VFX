    text: Directional lights are a simple scene-wide global light, which impacts
      all objects. These are best used for things like the sun in outdoor scenes.
      You can rotate a directional light or adjust it's intensity to replicate things
      like time of day. The position of a directional light doesn't matter, the light
      is cast from an infinite distance.
